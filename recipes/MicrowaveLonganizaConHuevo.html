<h3>
    New way to experience eggs!
</h3>
<p>
    A delicious huevos breakfast ready in 10 minutes! "Longaniza is very similar to 
    chorizo," says Yoly, the recipe submitter. "Longaniza is made with minced meat, whereas 
    chorizo is made with ground meat. It is a favorite dish at Mexican breakfast tables, and 
    now you can make your own longaniza con huevos at home in minutes."

        5 ounces longaniza, casing removed

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>
        Place longaniza in a microwave-safe bowl, cover with a paper towel, and microwave 
        for 1 minute. Remove bowl from microwave and break up longaniza. Cover with paper 
        towel and microwave 1 minute more. Remove bowl, stir longaniza, cover, and microwave 
        1 additional minute. 
       </li>
       <li>
        Remove bowl from microwave and stir in eggs, mixing until well incorporated. Return 
        bowl to the microwave and cook for 45 seconds. Stir and continue cooking until eggs

        Cook's Note:

        Drain bowl if longaniza releases grease before adding eggs. I used Aldi(R)'s brand 
        of longaniza, which I find not to be greasy.
