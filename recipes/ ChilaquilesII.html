<h3>
    Authentic Mexican dish that easy to make!
</h3>
<p>
    "Easy, authentic Mexican recipe that my mom taught me," says Jessica Mariscal. "It's a 
    casserole of tortilla chips mixed with eggs and salsa, and topped with cheese. Serve 
    with refried beans."

<h3>
    Ingredients
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        2 cups oil for frying    
    </li>
    <li>
        ¼ cup chopped onion
    </li>
    <li>
        30 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn into strips   
    </li>
    <li>
        6 eggs, lightly beaten  
    </li>
    <li>
        2 teaspoons salt
    </li>
    <li>
        1 (7.75 ounce) can Mexican style hot tomato sauce
    </li>
    <li>
        ½ cup water
    </li>
    <li>
        ½ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
    </li>
</ul>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>

       <li>
        In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
        Carefully stir in the onion and tortilla strips. Fry until tortilla strips are 
        crisp and golden brown. Remove from heat, and drain on paper towels. Drain the 
        skillet, leaving only a thin residue of oil. 
       </li>
       <li>
        Over medium heat, return tortillas to the skillet, and stir in the eggs. Season 
        with salt. Cook and stir until eggs are firm.
       </li>
       <li>
        Mix Mexican style hot tomato sauce and water into the skillet. Reduce heat, and 
        simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Top with cheese. Continue cooking until 
        cheese has melted.

        Editor's Note 

        We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention 
        value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and 
        temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.
