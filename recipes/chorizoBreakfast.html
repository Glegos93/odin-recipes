    Pico de Gallo:

        ½ cup diced sweet onion
    
    ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
    
    1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
    
    1 lime, juiced
    
        1 teaspoon minced garlic
    
        ⅛ teaspoon garlic salt
    
        1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
    
        3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
    
        2 (10 ounce) bags frozen sweet potatoes
    
        salt and ground black pepper to taste
    
        1 (1 pound) ground chorizo sausage
    
        4 eggs
    
        4 avocados, peeled and sliced
    
        ¼ cup crumbled Cotija cheese
    
        1 teaspoon Mexican-style hot sauce (such as Valentina®) (Optional)
    

    Directions
    
        Combine tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapeno, lime juice, minced garlic, and garlic salt in a bowl; stir to combine. Transfer 1/2 cup pico de gallo to a second bowl and stir in black beans. Cover both bowls and set in the refrigerator.
    
        Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sweet potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until browned and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes.
    
        Meanwhile, cook and stir chorizo in a second skillet over medium heat until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes.
    
        Distribute cooked chorizo, sweet potatoes, black bean mixture, and avocado amongst 4 bowls. Sprinkle with Cojita cheese.
    
        Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Crack eggs into the pan and cook until outer edges become opaque, about 1 minute. Cover the skillet and reduce heat to low. Cook until whites are set and yolks are set to your desired firmness, 4 to 6 minutes.
    
        Place an egg on top of each bowl. Serve with more pico de gallo and hot sauce.
